We are population ecologists investigating the abiotic and biotic drivers of speciesâ€™ distributions, with a focus on how global change influences range limits and extinction risk. We are also interested in understanding the motivations and practices behind natural resource use by local communities in tropical regions. Our research combines demographic data, manipulative lab and field experiments, and mathematical models to address pressing conservation and management challenges in a rapidly changing world.
